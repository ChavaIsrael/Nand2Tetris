## VM translator
The code was written in python,
so no need to compile.

In order to run the program you need to write the command:

```

py VMtranslator.py path\fileName.vm

```
path is the path of fileName.vm in the computer.
The output file will be in the path of fileName.vm and it's name will be fileName.asm
